# libreDSSP
A GPL Licensed DSSP Interpreter

This is a work in progress. At time of writing, it's really just a framework.

One barrier that I'm running into is the difficulty of finding a clear and unambiguous specification for this language.
Therefore I will not assert that this implementation is compliant with any official standard (if any even exist) only that it is close enough to be called DSSP and that it is reasonably practical.
